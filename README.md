# Public, private, and role-based routes in React

The idea is simply prevent the app to generate unnecessary routes, rather checking the role on each route and
showing fallback UI it would be a great idea to generate only the routes in which user have access,
so if the user navigate manually to a route ie: (typing in the address bar)
he/she will get 404 Not Found screen because route is not registered.

```
File: src/config/Rolesexport default {
SUPER_ADMIN: 'SUPER_ADMIN',
ADMIN: 'ADMIN',
MANAGER: 'MANAGER',
CUSTOMER: 'CUSTOMER',
GUEST: 'GUEST'
};
```
